Procedurally Generated Game

# Short description:
The driver in the truck has one very important task – to get the shipment from point A to point B unharmed and as fast as possible. The load is test tubes full of life saving vaccine. The road he drives on is full of obstacles and he has to overcome them. If he doesn’t make it on time people will die. Every time when the truck falls into a hall, hit a stone or an animal the truck gets broken. The only way  to fix the truck is by collecting coins and tools. Get the job done and do not waste people’s lives!
